## What is API3 DAO?

[API3 DAO](https://dao.api3.org) To decentralize the governance of both dAPIs and the project as a whole, API3 will be governed by a DAO. The governance will be entirely decentralized and open, meaning that all stakeholders will be able to participate in the governance of the project directly.
